## 🧠 Groq AI Integration

SafeSpace uses **Groq AI** for ultra-fast, intelligent safety features:

- **Text Analysis**: Detects harmful or concerning language in chats and alerts users.
- **Audio Monitoring**: Recognizes distress sounds and initiates emergency protocols.
- **Safe Zones**: Uses AI suggestions for frequently visited areas to establish safety zones.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Instantly sends AI-generated context-aware messages to emergency contacts, including location data.

Groq's low-latency inference enables real-time safety insights, making SafeSpace a truly proactive safety assistant.
